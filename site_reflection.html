      <h1>GROUP REFLECTION</h1>

      <h2>Braydan Shalders </h2>
        <p class="body"> Group Reflection Text</p>

      <h2>Carisse Wu‚ÄØ </h2>
        <p class="body"> Still feels eternally blessed to be appointed in the Wildcats! After working on A2 with all members of the Wildcats, I am very confident that we will do better and ace our A3. Beyond grateful to have Daniel as our group leader. This time around, the flow of the project is smooth and very well‚ÄØorganized. For instance, the workload for A3 seems impossible at first but after Daniel did the division of tasks and after they are broken down into multiple smaller parts and delegated evenly to all group members, it wasn‚Äôt too bad overall.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ </p>
        <p class="body"> What can be improved hmmm‚Ä¶. I still hope I have the courage to speak up more during the meetings. I am still learning :)‚ÄØ‚ÄØ </p>
        <p class="body"> Also, one thing that surprised me the most was Daniel came up with the‚ÄØDnDeasy‚ÄØlogo so quickly‚ÄØ(in‚ÄØone day‚Äôs‚ÄØtime). The logo of‚ÄØDnDeasy‚ÄØwas fantastically beautiful and the‚ÄØDnDeasy‚ÄØweb application looks so legit too. My groupmates did a good job really! </p>
        <p class="body"> Apart from teamwork, the biggest takeaway from this group project is time management. Even though we have limited time to work on A3 as we have loads of assignments to work on at the same time, we still managed to handle A3 well. I have learnt how to apportion my jobs and manage my time well despite having many other assignments on hand.‚ÄØ </p>
        <p class="body"> I personally think that the GitHub log of activity couldn‚Äôt fully reflect our group‚Äôs work on this assignment.‚ÄØ </p>
        <p class="body"> Lastly, no words can express my gratitude to all the members of Wildcats! I would consider myself really blessed to have the chance to work with them and learn a lot from them throughout both A2 and A3.‚ÄØ </p>

      <h2>Daniel Nanthathammiko  </h2>
        <p class="body"> There is a clear benefit when working with the same group of people for an extended period as you can create a comradery which is extremely important as it makes you want to strive for excellent results for everyone‚Äôs benefit. This is true in the real world when you must work with people to deliver an outcome. The better you get along, the better the ride. </p>
        <p class="body"> We were able to build upon our workflow from A2 to streamline our efforts in A3 by utilizing more of the systems provided to us such as MS Teams tasks and sharable files which we could all add and review each other‚Äôs work onto our live working template. This has cut down time in compiling for submission allowing us more time to review and refine. </p>
        <p class="body"> We could improve on providing adequate opportunities to each team member to step up and setup meetings, take minutes, compile submission documents and so on. I feel these would allow the team to grow into leaders by taking charge and ownership of the necessary aspects of group work. </p>
        <p class="body"> What has surprised me is the quality of work and professionalism displayed by everyone in the group as it isn‚Äôt something you would perhaps expect from a university subject. The skills the team have shown on creating the mock-up web application has been awesome as well. </p>
        <p class="body"> I‚Äôve learned that there needs to be a natural understanding of order within a group. I had been delegated the team leader in A2 which carried over to A3 in which my capacity was really to just keep tabs with the team and perhaps make some decisions to progress the work. Everyone really stepped it up this submission which was pleasing. </p>

      <h2>Glenn Tang  </h2>
        <p class="body"> Group Reflection Text</p>
        <p class="body"> Nearing the end of the semester and another towards our final assessments, another project with these guys and we figured a lot of things out from the previous one. A lot was discussed earlier on as we transition from A2 to A3 on how we were able to make things work a lot more fluid like reporting throughout the process, taking on the minutes into the formatted section as we go and organising our meetings prior with the agenda already written down. </p>
        <p class="body"> In all honesty, there wasn‚Äôt much that could‚Äôve been improved, I felt like throughout this assignment, we all just flowed a lot more smoothly which led to this assignment feeling a lot easier than the last. One thing that was surprising for myself was probably the learnings that we took on from the last assignment and how quickly we were able to transition into this assignment and get the ball rolling. It didn‚Äôt take us long to get things assigned and start the process of reporting and creation straight away. </p>
        <p class="body"> Team work plays a huge key in a group assignment, working with these guys has shown me that despite all of the previously bad group experiences I‚Äôve had, there are some really solid ones out there.</p>
      <h2>Harmony Kloppenburg  </h2>
        <p class="body"> Looking back at the time spent with the Wildcat‚Äôs I would say it has been one of my better university experiences. All team members were pleasant, willing to do anything asked and for the most part, we as a group had ‚Äúgood vibes‚Äù. I believe this was one of the major factors contributing to how well we performed in the previous assessment.   </p>
        <p class="body"> Although the overall experience was great, there was still something that stuck out to me as an aspect we could have improved on. Such being the delegation, as some members were first to put their hand up and have their say for some elements of the assignment, while there werer times where we all took a back seat and waited to be allocated a task. I can see where the politeness and agreeableness nature of our group comes in and I will say I even played a part. However, this passive approach felt like it delayed us from carrying out and progressing through the assignment.   </p>
        <p class="body"> Something that surprised me was our team‚Äôs comradery. Sure people make lifelong friends in university and I wouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs us. However, I felt it wasn‚Äôt necessary for us to be in the same room or even meeting at least once in real life. The space created on teams allowed us to communicate effectively, which paired well with everyone‚Äôs friendliness and genuine willingness to help out or even ask questions. I will say that me doing the ‚ÄúOk gesture‚Äù one time, turned into a meme‚Ä¶ and I love that.   </p>
        <p class="body"> Group work with this team has actually taught me better time management, not for me personally (I will most definitely still leave things to the last minute). But in a group setting (and individual), it really is better to get the small and easy things out of the way first.   </p>
        <p class="body">As said in the previous assignment the Github log of activity is not very reflective of the group's work on the assignment, as some members did not want to push their content un till fully finalised. That being said I feel like we (I know I did) forgot about adding the report to the website, and Daniel stepped up and did the majority for us. I would also like to add that other members took on other tasks and roles which do add up and play vital roles in the submission of the assignment.  </p>
        <p class="body"> Thanks, guys for a wonderful semester and I can‚Äôt wait to see what we end up creating for A4 üëå. </p>

      <h2>Zhen Rong Xavier Tan  </h2>
        <p class="body"> Just as mentioned in A2, I‚Äôm fortunate to be part of this group for the duration of group work in this subject. Everyone is hard working, and active in all aspects of the project that it really puts my mind at ease when it comes to the due dates, and project outcomes. When others in the group make conversation during meetings, it really helped in encouraging myself to speak up more, and express my ideas, when otherwise I would have just went with the flow. </p>
        <p class="body"> Coming out of A2, it was clear at first that there were some flaws to our work flow, in terms of documentation and compilation. These things were not properly sort out during A2, which was likely due to the fact that we were still getting to know each other and work as a team. However, for A3, we were able to organise everything that we could, down to documentation and presentation, quickly so that we could focus on the larger aspects of the project. </p>
        <p class="body"> What we could have improved on was maybe the clarity on workload distributions. We did use the task manager on MS teams, which was a great help in reminding us on what we needed to complete for the report, but we didn‚Äôt use it so much for the project prototype/artefact. As a result, there would be moments of confusion or disorganisation as to who would be doing what pages of the DnDeasy website. Ultimately, it wasn‚Äôt so much of an issue, as through meetings, members would step up to complete parts of the prototype. </p>
        <p class="body"> Since in A3, there is a lot more creative freedom involved when it came to the execution of the project idea, I was surprised to see the ability for logo design, and even marketing advertisements from Daniel. Other members also showed professionalism towards the report documentation and project prototypes, that it was surprising that you could consider them Year 1 (for the most part) uni students. </p>
        <p class="body"> For this assignment, I feel like I‚Äôve definitely improved on taking initiative when it comes to tasks and developing ideas, using full use of tools and technology to help visualise to other members on how certain website features would function. I think part of this improvement comes from the fact that we have been working together for quite some time now, and I have gotten to know the group better. And from that, I learned that strong group bonds are a great contributor to the success of the group. </p>

      <h2>Conclusion  </h2>
        <p class="body"> The Wildcats have shown once again that a diverse group of students from all walks of life can indeed get on the same page and achieve some significant deliverables that we can truly be proud of. Our personalities and stages of life range significantly and yet we could find common ground so quickly, all during a pandemic and meeting in an online environment only. </p>
        <p class="body"> Building on our success from the A2 submission, we were able to get on track and progress through this submission with relative ease. It has been fantastic to see everyone‚Äôs positive attributes and work ethic come through in our regular catch ups and in our deliverable outcomes for submission. The quality of work and input from all team members is something not easily found in many group settings as it can be quite daunting having to work with new people or perhaps there are too many strong-willed people. </p>
        <p class="body"> There is a balance to be struck in group work settings as you cannot have too many people that are quiet, or egomaniacs. Even though it is not possible to ‚Äúchoose‚Äù your teammates, you need to find the best way forward as a group and personally as the working life is full of uncontrollable situations with groups of people. This group has learned skill on establishing a clear understanding of each other‚Äôs personalities, skills, and approach to work. Learning this, you can tackle many other instances of group work by getting an understand of the players and the dynamics to begin employing approaches such as soft skills, diplomacy, clear and direct communications as well as subtle messages to get the desired outcomes. </p>
        <p class="body"> Our group has been a bit of a unicorn as we‚Äôre probably the exception to the rule. We have truly gotten along well and have the utmost respect for each other and so pull in the same direction. Listening to other groups in our class has kept us very grounded and allowed us to not take this situation for granted as there will be plenty more group activities that we will need to conquer outside of this class. </p>
        <p class="body"> As a group, we‚Äôve been excited to deliver our project artefact and completed A3 submission as it is a group effort of a high order. Long live the Wildcats. </p>
