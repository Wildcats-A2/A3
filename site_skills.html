          Below is a justification for each position required for our project to move forward and provide an ROI (Return On Inverstment) for our angel investors that saw potential in our product and provided venture capital to move this into the next phase.

        <h2>MARKETING MANAGER</h2>
        <h3>Position Justification</h3>
        <p class="body">
          Marketing initiatives are crucial for any commercial product, especially when investment funds have been secured. Marketing is even more critical for a digital product in a sea of products that can lack differentiation.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          It is assumed that our project idea is either close to minimum viable product or is ready to ship as it would be near impossible to secure venture capital without details on ROI (Return on investment) and continued monetisation of our app.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          Being an imagination-based board game with deep story line, Dungeons and Dragons clearly has a devoted following which may prove difficult to compel them into utilising an assistive application to enhance their game play. This is where a marketing manager/guru would come in.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          We would rely on their experience to identify features that would enrich the quality of the game for all users, create a level playing field for newbies (like me) and to help with the imaginative aspects of the game.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          I would expect that someone in this position would have experience in marketing web applications and mobile games, search engine optimisation techniques, strategies to generate product interest and player trials of the product as well as have certifications in modern advertising platforms such as Google, Facebook etc.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          At my current real-world job, we also use marking tools such as Hubspot for lead generation for our products which is handy. I would imagine in the instance of a SaaS product (Software as a subscription, although SaaS is used with many other acronyms…) we would want someone that understands that we need to convert users on free accounts to premium users that are willing to place their credit card on file for regular billing, providing long term earnings.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          A marketing manager would be responsible in ensuring we have a minimum viable product that would provide actual earnings as well as providing continued summarised feedback to our development team so that we could work on the next sellable features.
