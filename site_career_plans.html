    <h1>CAREER COMPARISONS</h1>

      <p class="body">
        As we discussed in A2, our group selected jobs which fit into categories previously called ‘Back of house’ and ‘Front of house’ as well as an extra mixed bag category of Managerial/Industry expectations and experience. Upon reflection, we can further define these as Backend development, Frontend development and Managerial.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        Now that we’re looking further into our own project, we have become more aware of what is required to achieve a goal and what skills we need to bring in to see our project come to life.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        Using this gained knowledge and applying it to our own chosen jobs, we can see in a real-world sense where the skills and experience fit in the scheme of things.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        Below is an image displaying the general requirements of our chosen ideal jobs. An overall commonality was that in a real workplace, all our positions would complement each other which is quite interesting when we consider how we will achieve our project goals.
      </p>
      <img class="centre" src="site/images/job_comparisons.png">
      <p class="body">
        We can see that engineering, development and systems management roles crossed off more back of house requirements. We can see that jobs that fit into the “Backend” category required significant amounts of programming languages to be utilized and required a general understanding of back-end tech stacks.
      </p>
      <img class="centre" src="site/images/graph1.png">
      <p class="body">
        Now to the frontend, logically we grouped these together due to the client facing nature of the roles and the soft skills that were required. Only two of our jobs really covered soft skills (being able to talk to stakeholders for example), dealing with clients and consultation. This is an entirely different skillset that requires confidence and quick thinking as clients can change their minds quickly or may need hand holding through the many cycles of a project.
      </p>
      <img class="centre" src="site/images/graph2.png">
      <p class="body">
        The managerial category defined requirements to manage projects, workloads or utilize management philosophies such as AGILE/SCRUM.
      </p>
      <img class="centre" src="site/images/graph3.png">
      <p class="body">
        Our career goals are different when considered in isolation as they generally have very specific language requirements or technical understandings related to the employers’ requirements. Overall, they have many commonalities as well such as project experience, knowledge of programming and experience on many different platforms.
