        <h1>TEAM PROFILE</h1>
        <h2>WILDCATS</h2>
        <p class="body">
          Who are we? The Wildcats! Who are we gonna beat? The Wildcats!<br>
          We are indeed the Wildcats.<br>
          We adopted this team name as we are not your standard cat, we think outside of the box and survive by getting things done.<br>
          Nothing being fed to us, just pure agility, swift thinking and hunger for survival.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>OUR GROUP, OUR RESULTS</h2>
        <p class="body">
          Our group is full of differing personality types which has helped to create a positive working dynamic as we have been able to quickly identify our strengths, weaknesses, and personality types within the first couple of meetings.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          Many of our personality types were very logical and rational with the group wanting a positive team environment and so were prepared to get on with the job and take on tasks that benefitted the team overall.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          A couple of us had stronger personality types on paper however, having strong personalities did not equate to ego clashes. If anything, it has helped to move our assignment forward as it allowed for us to throw ideas into our public sphere and have the rationale of the group dictate the path forward.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          Many of us are visual learners with a couple of being more theoretical and rational in the way the intake information. This has been great in our group dynamic as we have found many interpretations of the same information which has led to us discussing topics more in-depth to reach a consensus.
