        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p class="body">
          During the pandemic and a continuing series of lockdowns, we have been boredom struck as we are forced to stay at home. Although there are plenty of distractions around us such as our devices, social media, streaming services and, video games, all of these have one glaring issue, they generally bring us right back to reality! Let’s bring back board game play and start using our imaginations to entertain us once again.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          <img class="article" src="project-dndeasy/3D Logo.png">
          Hence, we would like to introduce DnDeasy to the public. The objective of this project is to provide a simple and enjoyable way for those who have never played Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) to get across the very basics of character creation, character sheets, gameplay, and general tips so that you can keep up with those that are more experienced. By focusing on simplicity of information delivery with a simple and clean user interface, guidance on the key areas of D&D such as character creation and character sheets, we believe this will appeal to people who are keen to give it a try. As we plan to offer this as a freemium service, there won’t be any barriers for new players regarding costs as there are none for basic usage of the web application. The deeper users get in our app and game play, the premium side of the application comes into play to offer more functionality to truly allow the user to take control of their game play with options such as multiple characters, customizable interfaces etc. This web application will be a worthy companion for those who want to spend their leisure time learning and playing D&D.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          How will our web application differ from others on the market? It won’t be the traditional boring one-paged website and eventually will offer more functionality such as customizable UI to capture an audience that may not be fulfilled by competing applications. Other unique selling points include a clean and interactive platform to keep new end-users actively engaged by guiding them throughout their character creation process, maintaining their character sheets (accessible offline as well) and provide on the fly tips to aide game play. Users will undoubtedly enjoy the game without feeling uneasy or worried if the character they created was passable for the game or feeling underqualified to play with those more experienced!

        <h2>MOTIVATION</h2>
        <p class="body">
          Starting as a fun idea from Harmony’s A1 project, the Wildcats were motivated by her Dungeons and Dragons character creation project as it presented the group with an opportunity to research existing competitors, flesh out the specification and ultimately delve into the technology stack that is now standard in the IT/Web Application space.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          Although only a few of the team have actually played Dungeons and Dragons, it represented an excellent challenge for the Wildcats as it has pushed those that know the game to look at what features would attract any new player (keeping in mind what would ignite interest in the game from those with no inclination for imagination based games) and the remainder of us to build up the skills to research and execute a project to the highest standard, even if you aren’t the target audience.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          At its core, the project is just a Web Application that utilizes current frameworks such as MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS) to handle specific aspects of the Web Application to provide a user a seamless encounter with our project. It is obvious that any future employer will see the project and will look past the subject matter and will be able to identify that all members in the Wildcats would now have experience in what is a hot industry topic right now.

        <h2>LANDSCAPE</h2>
        <p class="body">
          Currently, there are many online websites that are aimed at providing resources to enhance the D&D experience, such as D&D Beyond and Roll20. However, these competitors are aimed at the broadest spectrums of resources, providing tools for character creation and campaign creation, to virtual table tops that can map out scenarios.
        </p>
          <p class="body">
          From a new players point of view, it is easy to get lost on where to start, and even easier to become overwhelmed from the overflow of information. In comparison, DnDeasy aims to allow new players to learn the basics from scratch.
        </p>
          <p class="body">
          To do this, the website will heavily simplify the processes to set up the game, and dilute content so that it does not overwhelm new users, which in turn should smoothen out the learning experience.
        </p>
          <p class="body">
          An example of this is in the character creation tool. Instead of providing users with the full list of available options for classes in the game, DnDeasy would only limit choices down to three. Similarly, this would be the case for selecting a character’s race and background. Another feature that simplifies the character creation process would be automated stat distribution based on the previously selected character class and race.
        </p>
          <p class="body">
          With the combination of these features, we hope to be able to provide tools to users who are new to D&D, without steering them away due to its complexity.

        <h2>PROJECT AIM</h2>
        <p class="body">
          Our primary aim is to make it easier to learn how to play D&D, get more people having fun and playing with friends. Our vision for this project is to create a web application that will take beginners through the whole character creation process and guide them through a character sheet. The web application will save the content that is created, so players will never lose or forget their characters.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          The premium version will allow users to create more characters and share them with others. The plan is to divide and conquer by creating smaller, more achievable goals, the project will come to life as the goals are completed.
        </p>
        <h2>GOAL 1 - CLEAN/MODERN UI</h2>
        <p class="body">
          Designing and maintaining a clean and functional User Interface (UI) will be paramount to this web application becoming a successful addition to Dungeons and Dragons gameplay. Why is this important to us? We want this to be the “go to” app that fast tracks new Dungeons and Dragons players understanding and enjoyment of the game. By keeping the UI simple, understandable, yet visually appealing, we hope that it will be intuitive to use, provide clear information in a readable format as well as be responsive in its design so we can scale to different screen sizes and still convey the information in a clear manner.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          <img style="max-height: 400px; padding-left:40%; padding-right: 40%;" src="images/report/app_screenshot1.PNG">
          For the test web application, our goal is to use advanced CSS and Javascript to provide a realistic run through of the web application that should be close to the production version. Aided by visual drawings from apps such as Procreate to add a depth to the test web application, we believe it will convey the vision behind DnDeasy.
        </p>
        <h2>GOAL 2 - SIMPLIFIED OPTIONS</h2>
        <p class="body">
          Within our project, we aim to have a character creation tool that is concise and easy to use. Having this feature is imperative to playing DnD and is usually one of, if not the most daunting aspect of getting started. Due to this, we aim to implement a character creation tool that allows for some freedom of creation, but also is not overwhelming such that newer players are not intimidated by the potential complications that arise when creating a character. Our plan is to have this feature only provide a reduced selection of choices for attributes such as race, to help minimize inexperienced players feeling overwhelmed. Within the prototype, we aim to use a mixture of JavaScript and CSS to give a skeleton to this feature, providing an insight into what the feature will become and what it is capable of.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          This feature will become one of the prevalent selling points of DnDeasy. It is due to this that it is crucial that this feature be not only user-friendly, but capable of lowering the intimidation factor of getting started with DnD for potential users / players.
        </p>
        <h2>GOAL 3 - </h2>
        <p class="body">
          INSERT TEXT GLENN
        </p>
        <h2>GOAL 4 - ACCOUNTS/SUBSCRIPTION</h2>
        <p class="body">
          With a web application project like ours, login features play a vital role in ensuring that the user’s data will be saved securely and can be retrieved when needed. In our case, one main bulk of data that will be tied to user accounts are their character sheets, and the data that comes with them. A function like this seems trivial but plays an important role in the function of the website in allowing users to keep their saved characters. Additionally, user accounts can allow us to create premium features, made only available to those who pay for a subscription plan. Not only does this provide more advanced features to dedicated users, but also provides a means of monetization for the website that could lead to more advanced developments in the website.

        <h2>PLANS & PROGRESS</h2>
        <strong>BEGINNINGS AND CURRENT VISION</strong>
        <p class="body">
          The beginning of DnDeasy was quite an interesting one for our group as most of the Wildcats have never actually played the game. What began as one team members A1 project quickly became our focus for the remainder of the semester. The scope has grown since our A2 submission, mainly because we felt that the project in its initial form might be considered too simplistic and limiting (only focused on character creation, large website format) which would either hinder potential adoption of the web application or would effectively stagnate the project all together as its limited scope would mean that the project would not truly require any further work since the main objective of providing basic character creation and maintaining a character sheet could be met without much perceivable effort.
        </p>
        <img style="max-height: 400px; padding-left:35%; padding-right: 35%;"  src="site/images/MockUps/character_creation.png">
          <i>Initial concept</i>
        <p class="body">
          Although developing the project based on the initial concept would technically still prove difficult for us due to our inexperience, we needed to workshop the projects potential within the group so that we could further expand our own understanding of how to develop a web application, what skills we would need to gain and what experience we should seek out to begin understanding any consequences new features would bring on a deployed web application. (MongoDB n.d)
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          As we conducted further research into the technologies available to us regarding development of this web application, it has been decided that the web application should follow responsive design principles as it would allow us to market the web application to all device sizes (this is pretty important in a mobile first age), we also learned we could offer significantly more features without necessarily adding more stress if we consider long term development requirements as the road to developing such a web application has been travelled significantly by many others and so we could utilise those foundational frameworks to bring this to life without many stumbling blocks. (Web.dev 2020)
        </p>
        <img style="max-height: 400px; padding-left:10%; padding-right: 10%;"  src="site/images/mern-stack-b9q1kbudz0.png.jpeg">
        (MongoDB, 2021)
        <p class="body">
          Now that we are aware of full stack frameworks/technology stacks for web applications and can begin to grasp the concepts such as MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS) (MongoDB, 2021), we have the building blocks to bring this project to life based on our Minimum Viable Product (limiting features to ensure we have a functioning web application that is operational) as this allows us to achieve features such as user logins to store character data/sheets, provide focused training and tutorial guides based on the characters created/selected and time spent playing the game.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          This project has now evolved from a being a static information webpage to an interactive, personalised, and responsive web application that is capable of growing more as we begin to improve our own skills and implement more features.
